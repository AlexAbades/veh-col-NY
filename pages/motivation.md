<div class="text">
In this project, we use the New York City Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset which contains information about motor vehicle collisions in New York City. The dataset includes data on the date, time, location, severity, types of vehicle involve and contributing factors of collisions that occurred in New York City from 2012 to the present.

<div class="text">
We selected this dataset because motor vehicle collisions are a significant issue in New York City Boroughs. Collecting and analysing this dataset, we would like to expore and investigate the motor vehicle collisions characteristics finding interesting patterns and trends of them. Furthermore, understanding the factors that contribute to collisions can help reduce their frequency and severity. The dataset is also publicly available and contains a large amount of information, making it suitable for exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling.

Our goal for the end user's experience with this dataset would be to provide insights into the factors that contribute to motor vehicle collisions in New York City and to develop interactive visualizations that allows users to explore the data in an interactive and user-friendly manner. Specifically, We would like to provide visualizations that show the location, time, severity of collisions, contributing factors, motor vehicle type as well as any patterns or trends that emerge from the data. Untimately, our goal is to inform and help transportation planners and the police makers to decide and take additional measures such as in infrastructure, enforcement, or education to reduce the frequency and severity of collisions in specific regions resulting in improvement the safety and the well-being of individuals and communities.
